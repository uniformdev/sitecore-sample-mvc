    This file is not required and could be deleted, but it is kept for one purpose: 
      To keep this message and prevent Visual Studio from regenerating it, as in this case 
      it would be marked as Content which will result in being deployed to Sitecore, 
      overriding Sitecore's own web.config file and breaking it completely.
